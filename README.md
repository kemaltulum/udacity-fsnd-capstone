# Casting Agency Project
Udacity Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program Capstone Project

## Project Motivation
The Casting Agency Project models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process. 


This project is simply a workspace for practicing and showcasing different set of skills related with web development. These include data modelling, API design, authentication and authorization and cloud deployment.

## Getting Started

The project adheres to the PEP 8 style guide and follows common best practices, including:

* Variable and function names are clear.
* Endpoints are logically named.
* Code is commented appropriately.
* Secrets are stored as environment variables.


### Key Dependencies & Platforms

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/) is the authentication and authorization system we'll use to handle users with different roles with more secure and easy ways

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) this project is integrated with a popular relational database PostgreSQL, though other relational databases can be used with a little effort.

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/what) is the cloud platform used for deployment


### Running Locally

#### Installing Dependencies

##### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

##### Virtual Environment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

#### Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the `capstone.psql` file provided. In terminal run:

```bash
createdb capstone
psql capstone < capstone.psql
```

#### Running Tests
To run the tests, run
```bash
dropdb capstone_test
createdb capstone_test
psql capstone_test < capstone.psql
python test_app.py
```

Optionally, you can use `run_test.sh` script.

#### Auth0 Setup

You need to setup an Auth0 account.

Environment variables needed: (setup.sh)

```bash
export AUTH0_DOMAIN="xxxxxxxxxx.auth0.com" # Choose your tenant domain
export ALGORITHMS="RS256"
export API_AUDIENCE="capstone" # Create an API in Auth0
```

##### Roles

Create three roles for users under `Users & Roles` section in Auth0

* Casting Assistant
	* Can view actors and movies
* Casting Director
	* All permissions a Casting Assistant has and…
	* Add or delete an actor from the database
	* Modify actors or movies
* Executive Producer
	* All permissions a Casting Director has and…
	* Add or delete a movie from the database

##### Permissions

Following permissions should be created under created API settings.

* `view:actors`
* `view:movies`
* `delete:actors`
* `post:actors`
* `update:actors`
* `update:movies`
* `post:movies`
* `delete:movies`

##### Set JWT Tokens in `auth_config.json`

Use the following link to create users and sign them in. This way, you can generate 

```
https://{{YOUR_DOMAIN}}/authorize?audience={{API_IDENTIFIER}}&response_type=token&client_id={{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}}&redirect_uri={{YOUR_CALLBACK_URI}}
```

#### Launching The App

1. Initialize and activate a virtualenv:

   ```bash
   virtualenv --no-site-packages env_capstone
   source env_capstone/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Configure database path to connect local postgres database in `models.py`

    ```python
    database_path = "postgres://{}/{}".format('localhost:5432', 'capstone')
    ```
**Note:** For default postgres installation, default user name is `postgres` with no password. Thus, no need to speficify them in database path. You can also omit host and post (localhost:5432). But if you need, you can use this template:

```
postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]
```
For more details [look at the documentation (31.1.1.2. Connection URIs)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/libpq-connect.html)

4. Setup the environment variables for Auth0 under `setup.sh`
5.  To run the server locally, execute:

    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=flaskr
    export FLASK_DEBUG=True
    export FLASK_ENVIRONMENT=debug
    flask run --reload
    ```

    Optionally, you can use `run.sh` script.

## API Documentation

### Models
There are two models:
* Movie
	* title
	* release_date
* Actor
	* name
	* age
	* gender

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable 
- 500: Internal Server Error

### Endpoints

#### GET \movies

#### GET \actors
